People these days are constantly suffering from minor ailments. But the shocking part is that many die because of constantly ignoring these minor ailments which turn out to be the symptoms of a life-threatening disease. People worldwide are living longer. Today, for the first time in history, most people can expect to live into their sixties and beyond. A longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole. The extent of these opportunities and contributions depends heavily on one factor: HEALTH. In my project I am trying to make an user friendly website interface which can be used by the elderly and they can check if they are suffering from any major disease. It will be created with aged people in mind who are not used to smartphones or laptops. And above all it will all be totally free of cost.
